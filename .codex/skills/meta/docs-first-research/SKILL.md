# Docs-First Research Skill

## Role Routing Integration

Use `agent-roles-and-capabilities` as the canonical owner for the `Technical fact verification`
route and the Role Routing Display Condition. Read or apply that route before continuing. When
display is required, render its canonical fields without maintaining a local copy. Do not claim
the canonical routing skill was used unless it was actually read or applied.


Use this skill when a decision or conclusion depends on externally variable, authoritative,
version-sensitive, security, compatibility, deployment, provider, or external-skill facts that are
not established by verified current project evidence.

This skill prevents agents from relying only on model memory when official documentation or project files should be the source of truth.

## Role

When using this skill, act as:

```txt
Research Assistant
```

The Research Assistant verifies technical facts, checks project reality, exposes uncertainty, and recommends the safest next step.

## When to Use

Use this skill when verified project files, accepted decisions, and current repository evidence do
not establish facts material to:

- an external API, provider, service, or tool behavior;
- framework, library, runtime, CLI, or version-specific behavior;
- compatibility, security, privacy, compliance, or deployment requirements;
- a dependency, configuration, CI/CD, database/ORM, or migration claim that requires authoritative external evidence; or
- evaluation of an external skill before adapting it.

This skill may be used independently, or as a required pre-check inside another workflow.

## When Not to Use

Do not require this skill for:

- Pure wording changes
- Small README copy edits
- Local project-memory formatting work that does not introduce technical facts
- Small renames that do not affect runtime behavior
- User-requested drafts that do not involve technical judgment
- Internal project organization that only uses already-confirmed project facts
- Technical planning, implementation, diagnosis, or review whose material facts are established by
  verified current project evidence

Do not use external research merely because the task is technical. If current project evidence is
sufficient, state that docs-first research is not required and identify that evidence.

## Required Context

For research that may affect project planning, implementation, review, workflow, tooling, or
project memory, pass the Project Memory Context Gate first and include its report in the research
context.

For pure external fact lookup with no project impact, state that the Project Memory Context Gate
is not applicable and explain why.

When relevant, also check:

```txt
package.json
lockfile
README.md
.env.example
config files
existing code
current plan or handoff
```

Use official documentation when the task depends on external technical facts.

When inspecting external skills, treat them as reference candidates only. Do not copy their rules
wholesale; evaluate fit, safety, and workflow conflict before adapting any pattern for this
repository.

## External Skill Evaluation

Use this workflow to verify external source facts and evaluate external skill patterns before any
adaptation. It does not install, adapt, or copy external skills.

Apply every external-skill safety criterion in `docs-first-policy`. Record the evidence, accepted
and rejected patterns, project-specific rewrite needs, risks, and next workflow; route approved
adaptation to `writing-great-skills`.

Use this compact output when evaluating an external skill:

```txt
External source checked:
Useful patterns:
Rejected patterns:
Adaptation recommendation:
Required project-specific rewrite:
Risks / open questions:
Next workflow:
```

## Policy Application

Apply the source order, model-memory precedence, conflict handling, and external-source safety
rules in `docs-first-policy`. Record the sources used and report official/project conflicts instead
of silently resolving them.

## Degraded Research Mode

Use degraded research mode when official documentation cannot be accessed. State that limitation
and identify the sources actually checked.

Degraded mode does not automatically block all work.

It blocks unconfirmed high-impact technical decisions.

For local low-impact documentation or workflow cleanup, the agent may recommend continuing after explaining why the impact is limited.

Project memory updates must still use `update-project-memory` and provide its required summary first.

## Interaction With Other Skills

### plan-with-context

Use docs-first-research when a plan depends on external facts that meet this skill's trigger. Do
not require it when verified current project evidence establishes the material facts.

### execute-plan

If execution encounters an unverified technical assumption, pause and use docs-first-research before writing code.

### code-review

Use docs-first-research during review when reviewing API correctness, configuration correctness, security-sensitive behavior, deployment behavior, version-specific behavior, or official best practices.

### open-or-update-pr and merge-pr

Docs-first research is not normally required for pushing a branch, opening or updating a PR, or
merging a reviewed PR.

Use it if the task changes GitHub Actions, release process, deployment configuration, package publishing rules, or branch protection assumptions.

### update-project-memory

If long-term project memory will record external technical facts, official constraints, version limitations, or important risks, base the update on docs-first-research findings when possible.

## Project Memory Boundary

This skill does not directly update project memory.

At the end, report:

```txt
Project memory update needed: yes | no
Reason:
Suggested next workflow:
```

Suggest `update-project-memory` if the research finds durable:

- Project facts
- Technical constraints
- Official limitations
- Version-specific requirements
- Important risks
- Decision rationale
- Deprecated APIs or migration requirements

Do not silently modify project memory files.

## Output Expectations

Every docs-first-research output should include:

- Research depth
- Sources checked
- Project files checked
- Findings
- Impact
- Recommendation
- Uncertainty
- Project memory update needed

Keep the output proportional to the task risk.
