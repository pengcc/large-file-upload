# Initialize Project Context Skill

## Role Routing Integration

Use `agent-roles-and-capabilities` as the canonical owner for the `Project initialization` route
and the Role Routing Display Condition. Read or apply that route when it is available. When display
is required, render its canonical fields without maintaining a local copy. If the canonical routing
skill is unavailable, use only the explicit provisional role-system fallback under `Capability
Areas and Role Profiles`; do not infer another route. Do not claim the canonical routing skill was
used unless it was actually read or applied.


## First-Run Operating Contract Integration

When this skill runs during first project adoption, first apply the repository agent operating
contract if present:

```txt
.codex/rules/agent-operating-contract.md
```

For first-run usage, the expected startup order is:

```txt
AGENTS.md
-> project-memory
-> agent-roles-and-capabilities
-> initialize-project-context
-> routed follow-up skill
```

Initialization must therefore be role-routed, not only file-scanning. It should identify the best next workflow after initialization, such as `update-project-memory`, `grilling`, `docs-first-research`, `project-architecture-plan`, or `plan-with-context`.

If goals, scope, requirements, constraints, or decision branches remain unclear after reading
available project context, recommend `grilling` as the next workflow.

Pass the Project Memory Context Gate defined in the `project-memory` skill before the
initialization report. As a context-diagnosis workflow, follow the central gate's continuation
rules without redefining them here.

Use this skill to initialize project context when a project is first connected to agent workflows.

This skill creates a clear project initialization analysis before feature planning begins. It does not implement features and does not execute plans.

## Role

When using this skill, act as:

```txt
Project Context Initializer
```

The Project Context Initializer inspects product documents, project plans, README files, docs, configuration, scripts, code, tests, Git state, and GitHub readiness, then reports what is known, missing, risky, or blocked.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user explicitly requests:

```txt
initialize-project-context
```

or:

```txt
Use initialize-project-context.
```

Also use it when:

- Agent workflows were just introduced to the project
- A new project is being handed to the agent for the first time
- An existing project is adopting agent-assisted workflows
- Project memory is empty, generic, stale, or incomplete
- Product documents and repo state may be inconsistent
- The agent is about to create the first formal feature plan
- GitHub / PR / publish readiness is unknown
- Tech stack, scripts, runtime, deployment, or validation commands are unclear

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill to:

- Implement a feature
- Execute a feature plan
- Refactor code
- Install dependencies without explicit user authorization
- Modify GitHub repo settings
- Configure branch protection or rulesets
- Create a release
- Deploy the project
- Silently write project memory
- Install, upgrade, relink, or configure global developer tooling
- Edit shell profiles, PATH, global Git configuration, or files outside the project root

Use `plan-with-context` for feature planning.

Use `execute-plan` for approved implementation.

Use `update-project-memory` for durable project memory updates.

Use `open-or-update-pr` for push plus PR creation/update and `merge-pr` for a separately authorized
immediate merge. Canonical persistent auto-merge is deferred.

## Core Purpose

```txt
initialize-project-context = first project context initialization + setup readiness analysis
```

It answers:

```txt
What is this project?
What does the product or plan say?
What does the repo currently show?
Are product goals, implementation state, and technical setup aligned?
What is missing or unclear?
What must be clarified before project memory or feature planning?
What manual setup tasks remain?
What project memory updates are recommended?
```

## Source Truthfulness

If required sources are missing, state that clearly.

Apply the Explicit Target Reference Guardrail from `agent-operating-contract` when an explicit
project target is missing, stale, obsolete, or inconsistent with its expected location.

Do not claim to have read a file, document, source, skill, or official documentation unless it was actually read.

## Source Priority

Read and compare available sources in this order:

1. User-provided product specification or product description
2. User-provided project development plan or roadmap
3. `README.md`
4. Product, architecture, planning, or design documents under `docs/`
5. Existing project memory under `.codex/project-memory/`, if present
6. `package.json`, lockfile, and package manager indicators
7. Framework and tool configuration files
8. `.env.example` and environment documentation
9. Existing source code
10. Existing tests
11. Git state and GitHub state

Do not infer the full product only from code if product or planning documents exist. Code may be incomplete, experimental, stale, or inconsistent with the plan.

An existing product plan or roadmap is an input to initialization, not a conflicting replacement
target. Preserve it as product-direction evidence, compare it with repo reality, and surface gaps
or stale assumptions without silently replacing either the document or project memory.

## Product / Plan vs Repo Reality Check

If a product description or project plan exists, compare it against the actual repository.

The analysis must distinguish:

```txt
Product / Plan says:
Repo currently shows:
Gap / Risk:
Question for user:
Recommended project memory update:
```

Examples:

- Product plan says authentication is required, but repo has no auth implementation: mark as gap.
- Product plan says Vercel deployment, but repo has no deployment config: mark as setup task.
- Product plan is silent, but repo uses Prisma: report repo fact and ask whether Prisma is the confirmed choice.
- Product plan says Next.js, and package.json confirms Next.js: record as confirmed repo fact.

## Formatter and Linter Readiness

During the Scripts and Validation Check, inspect existing project conventions before recommending
tooling. Check at least:

```txt
biome.json / biome.jsonc
eslint.config.* / .eslintrc*
prettier.config.* / .prettierrc*
package.json format and lint scripts
lockfiles and package-manager indicators
```

If Biome, ESLint, Prettier, or project-specific tooling exists, preserve it and report only
confirmed conflicts, gaps, or missing scripts. Do not replace or combine tools by default.

If no formatter or linter setup exists, add a Manual Setup Task that recommends Biome as the
default candidate. Biome adoption requires a separate approved plan. Initialization must not
install Biome, add dependencies, edit configuration, or change package scripts.

## Internal Project Facts vs External Technical Facts

Prioritize internal project facts first.

Internal facts include:

- files that exist
- scripts that exist
- package versions in package files
- configs that exist
- code paths that exist
- tests that exist
- Git remote and branch state

External technical facts include:

- current framework behavior
- version recommendations
- compatibility rules
- deployment provider behavior
- GitHub Actions behavior
- GitHub ruleset / auto-merge behavior
- security / auth / database best practices

Use `docs-first-research` when initialization analysis involves external technical facts, version recommendations, compatibility, deployment/GitHub Actions behavior, security/auth/database choices, or external technical constraints that may be written into project memory.

Do not use `docs-first-research` just to read repo-internal facts.

Read-only global diagnostics may be used to distinguish machine state from project-local state,
including executable paths, versions, mise status, PATH, shell profiles, package-manager
information, logs, and Git configuration. Do not mutate those sources.

If a required runtime or tool is missing or wrong, report the detected version, required version,
failing command, and whether the mismatch is global or project-local. Recommend a manual fix,
explain machine-wide risk, and wait for explicit approval before any global or out-of-project
change.

If official docs are unavailable, use degraded research mode and clearly separate:

```txt
Repo fact:
Provisional recommendation:
Unverified external assumption:
```

## Capability Areas and Role Profiles

Theme 8 does not define the full role system.

During initialization, detect capability areas such as:

- Product planning
- Project architecture
- Frontend framework
- Backend runtime
- UI design
- TypeScript
- Database
- Authentication / authorization
- Testing
- Accessibility
- Performance
- Deployment
- GitHub / publishing workflow
- Code review

If an `agent-roles-and-capabilities` skill exists, use or reference it to generate Agent Role Profile Suggestions.

If that skill does not exist, only output:

```txt
Capability areas detected:
Provisional role suggestions:
Role system status: agent-roles-and-capabilities not installed
```

Do not present role boundaries as confirmed if the role system skill does not exist.

The full role taxonomy, capability boundaries, and task-to-role routing belong to a later `agent-roles-and-capabilities` skill.

When initialization detects a capability area that would benefit from a future optional specialist
skill or pack, report it as an optional candidate only. Do not silently install, promote, or add
specialist packs during initialization. Use a current repository-owned catalog only when one
exists and is applicable.

## Required Project Initialization Report

Output a fixed report:

```md
# Project Initialization Report

## 1. Project Identity

## 2. Product / Plan Summary

## 3. Repo Reality Check

## 4. Tech Stack and Version Check

## 5. Scripts and Validation Check

## 6. Environment and Secrets Check

## 7. Git and GitHub Readiness

## 8. Deployment Readiness

## 9. Capability Areas Detected

## 10. Gaps, Risks, and Open Questions

## 11. Manual Setup Tasks

## 12. Recommended Project Memory Updates

## 13. Recommended Next Workflow

## 14. External / Global Actions
```

Section 14 must explicitly state `None` or list each approved external/global action with its
reason and result.

If the `agent-roles-and-capabilities` skill exists, section 9 may also include:

```txt
Agent Role Profile Suggestions:
```

If it does not exist, any role suggestions must be marked provisional.

## Save the Report

By default, save the full report to:

```txt
dev_locals/research-notes/YYYY-MM-DD-project-initialization-report.md
```

The report is local-only. It is not committed. It is not a long-term source of truth.

Long-term facts, decisions, and lessons must be written to `.codex/project-memory/` via `update-project-memory`.

Do not start feature implementation until initialization is complete and the user has approved any
required durable project-memory updates.

Saving is required when:

- This is first project initialization
- An existing project is first adopting agent-assisted workflows
- The report is long
- Multiple gaps exist
- Multiple manual setup tasks exist
- Multiple open questions exist
- The user explicitly asks to save it

For a tiny project with a short initialization, conversation-only output is acceptable.

## Gap and Question Handling

When information is missing, first classify gaps and questions.

Apply the shared `grilling` discipline so questions remain evidence-first, priority-ordered,
recommendation-led, and limited to blocking ambiguity.

Use these categories:

```txt
Blocking before project memory update
Needed before first feature planning
Nice to clarify later
```

Do not ask a long unordered list of questions.

Ask the highest-priority blocking questions first.

Ask one tight group of related questions at a time.

Provide a recommended answer or recommended direction for each question when possible.

## Project Memory Update Proposal

Do not silently write project memory.

The report must include recommended project memory updates grouped by file:

```txt
guideline.md:
- concise always-read Project Overview
- Current Scope
- Tech Stack and Runtime summary
- only directory, common-command, architecture, shared-language, and boundary facts that can
  materially change ordinary work across unrelated domains

topic-index.md:
- routing-only entries for confirmed conditionally relevant whole-file or exact-section fact owners
- exact fact, decision, and lesson heading pointers with explicit read-when conditions
- thin pointer to `project-memory` for source selection, complete-context expansion,
  missing/stale-index fallback, gate-status behavior, and continuation semantics

topics/*.md:
- confirmed current facts whose low common-path relevance justifies an indexed whole-file or
  exact-section owner
- no speculative, empty, or automatically generated topics

decisions.md:
- selected package manager
- selected framework
- selected database
- selected deployment provider
- GitHub workflow policy

lessons-learned.md:
- reusable setup lessons, if any
```

Initialization proposes this structure but does not create or modify durable memory directly.
Route every confirmed write through `update-project-memory`. Create a fact-topic file only when
confirmed facts fit neither the core nor an existing indexed whole-file/exact-section owner and the
approved update includes the corresponding index entry.

If information is clear enough, recommend:

```txt
Recommended next workflow: update-project-memory
```

If key information is unclear, mark:

```txt
Project memory update status: blocked
```

or:

```txt
Project memory update status: partial
```

Do not write guesses, unconfirmed technology choices, deployment strategy, GitHub workflow, or product goals as confirmed facts.

## Git and GitHub Readiness

Check:

- Whether the directory is a Git repo
- Current branch
- Default branch assumption
- Working tree status
- Remote origin
- GitHub repo identity if available
- GitHub CLI availability and auth if PR workflow matters
- Whether a PR workflow appears to exist
- Whether GitHub readiness is recorded in project memory

Do not automatically modify GitHub settings.

Do not configure branch protection, rulesets, required checks, or auto-merge.

If GitHub repo-level settings are unknown, record a manual setup task or recommend future setup check.

This readiness data supports later `open-or-update-pr` and `merge-pr`.

## Deployment Readiness

Identify deployment facts when available:

- Deployment provider named in product plan or README
- Deployment config files
- CI/CD config
- Environment variable requirements
- Build command
- Runtime assumptions

If deployment provider or strategy is unclear, mark it as an open question.

Do not deploy. Do not create release artifacts.

## Output Expectations

Keep the report factual and structured.

Always separate:

- confirmed facts
- repo evidence
- product/plan claims
- gaps
- risks
- assumptions
- recommendations
- questions

End with:

```txt
Recommended next workflow:
```

Possible next workflows:

- `update-project-memory`
- `plan-with-context`
- `docs-first-research`
- `grilling`
- `execute-plan`
- `initialize-project-context` after user provides missing docs
- `open-or-update-pr`
- `merge-pr`
